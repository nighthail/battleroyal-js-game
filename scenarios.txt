HOUR 1
fields
The island is completely foreign to you, but its a nice day and the landscape is beautiful.
If it wasnt for the looming fear of death, you might even go here for vacation.

HOUR 2
Coast
A warm breeze blows in from the pristine sea. You squint, but there seem to be no nearby land.
Stuck in the sand where sea meets shore, there is a boat.
SEARCH
BOAT FOUND
Looking closer, you see that the boat seem in working condition and even has an engine!
There seem to be no gas left though. Maybe you can find more somewhere?

HOUR 3

This feels too real to be a dream, but it has to be right? You try to think back, but your mind goes blank.
All you can remember was you were on your way to school (to study? To work? What were you studying?).

HOUR 4
shed
IF: BOAT FOUND
Heading back to were you started, you spot someone in the distance.

HOUR 5

This must be a dream. You would never kill anyone in real life, would you?
You're even sure you used to be vegan. Wait, didn't you take a job as a slaughter house last summer?

HOUR 6
Coast
Once you see the coast, you run towards the boat, stumbling but finding your footing.
You pour in the gasoline into the enginge and push the boat out in the water. Crossing your fingers, you pull the string.
The engine starts humming and the boat starts moving. Yes!
Fuck this island you think as you drive towards the horizon.

HOUR 1
cave
The island is completely foreign to you, but its a nice day. Despite the sun, you head towards the dark shades of a cave in the mountain nearby.
+SEARCH
After some searching, you find an entrance that looks like the one on the map, albeit smaller. Pulling on the handle, it seems to be locked.
Maybe the people who kidnapped you are inside?

HOUR 2

Bird song fill the tree crowns above you. Suddenly, you hear a branch crack and someone swearing.
You: Hello?
Player 1: Uhm... Don't kill me, ok?
A man steps forward, shivering and seemingly pale.

HOUR 3
Cave
IF: golden key AND gate found
You pull out the golden key and use it in the lock at the gate. The lock clicks and slides open.
Curious, you peak inside, but cannot see much. You take a deep breath and walk inside.
You take a few steps in and you're starting to see outlines as your eyes start to adjust.
Person: "uhm... hello. You werent supposed to see this"
A person who looks like a programmer is sitting shrimplike over a laptop. They look up at you, shyly.
YOU: Who are you?
Programmer: I'm the programmer. I made this game.
You: What game? Release me at once!
Programmer: I didn't wanna hurt anyone, i just wanted to learn javascript.
Tired, you roll your eyes.
Programmer: I cant let you leave you know.
IF EMP is equipped
You use the emp in your inventory, and suddenly the programemr crumbles over.
Programmer: "Nooo, my laptop!"
They kneel over and starts crying.
"I forgot to make a backup..."
You rolls your eyes yet again. What a n00b.
You: "Can I leave now?"
Behind the programmer, you see a red door with an exit sign. Weird how you didn't see it before.
As you open it, you look over your shoulder one last time. This was a weird experience but at least you are alive.
ENDING B: Cave
